## Project Reflections:

Building this personal portfolio has been a great learning experience. Prior to starting this project, I had no experience with React and Bootstrap, and my JavaScript skills were still developing. This project pushed me out of my comfort zone, allowing me to build a foundation in front-end development that I plan to continuously improve. 

As I expand my React skills, enchance my front-end capabilities, and take on more projects, I will continue to update this portfolio to showcase my latest work and skills. Though this project is my portfolio, it is also a reflection of my ongoing learning and passion for front-end and web development.
