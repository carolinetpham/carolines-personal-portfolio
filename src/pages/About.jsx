            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a second-year Computer Science and Design student at
                Northeastern University with a strong passion for all things
                front-end and design. Currently, I'm focusing my studies on
                software development, and I've had the privilege of honing
                my programming skills in Java through my coursework.
                Alongside my academic pursuits, I'm a self-taught enthusiast
                in creative tools like Figma and Illustrator. I find immense joy
                in blending my technical knowledge with a keen eye for
                design, bringing a unique perspective to the world of
                software development.</p>
